# Infosys_Springboard_Internship - Space Traffic Density Prediction

As space becomes increasingly crowded with satellites, space stations, and debris, predicting space traffic density has become crucial for safe and efficient space operations. 
This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict space traffic density based on factors such as orbital location, object type, and time of day.
The project aims to develop a real-time prediction function to forecast future traffic density, providing valuable insights for decision-making in space traffic management.
This innovative approach will help improve collision avoidance, satellite operations, and launch planning in the rapidly evolving field of space exploration and utilization.
